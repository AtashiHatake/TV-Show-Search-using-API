AJAX = async javascript and xml
it is basically making requests to load and save info seamlessly behind the curtains.

Eg : infinite scroll in reddit, instagram, tiktok, etc


API = Application programming interface
mostly used to retrieve a certain piece of data unlike AJAX which takes a whole web page (including HTML CSS) as source.

what is JSON? 
Java Script Object Notation = JSON
it is just a way of sending data from API to a browser, based on javascript objects, they are key value pairs.

query string : these are key value pairs seperated by "&"
eg : ?sort=desc&color=blue
here first key value pair is ?sort = desc
second one is color = blue

HTTP headers : pairs of information which go along with requests.
you will learn about them when learning Node.js 

FETCH API : 
- newer way of making requests with javascript
- supports promises unlike xml
