      <h2>Event Bubbling</h2>

    <p>
      when you click the button which is nested in paragraph tag due to this
      both alerts are fired when button is clicked (try it out) the more layers
      you have the more the alerts fired. we use evt.stopPropogation(); due to
      which any event after the child event (eg: button) is stopped BUT if you
      click the paragraph only paragrph will react and when you click button
      only button will react.
      <button>Click me</button>
